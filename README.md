# mLearn
mLearn is a living repository of curated links, scripts, and notebooks about a wide variety of machine learning topics.

# Structure
The structure of this repository is inspired by the book by Gavin Hackeling, (Mastering Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn)[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0W7EC0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1]. This structure might change in the future as I explore concepts and techniques more deeply, but for now it will be a good way for me to systematically visit all of the key machine learning ideas.
